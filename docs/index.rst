**Welcome to Yuzu Finance**
============================================

**Introduction to Yuzu**
-------------

Yuzu is a protocol for creating composable derivatives and structured products permissionlessly and with little to no smart contract code. 
The protocol provides several offerings built around the core smart contract infrastructure:

- Access to Yuzu-native derivatives / structured products markets [available now]

- The Yuzu Graph, which allows users to build their own markets using composable rules & integrations with other protocols seamlessly [available now]

- A DEX: the Yuzu Fruit Market, where users can trade their derivative / structured product tokens [coming soon]

Our whitepaper is here and our smart contract documentation is here. [need to embed links]

**What are derivatives?**
Derivatives are financial instruments that derive their payoff as a function of the price of a different instrument, the “underlying”. 

**What are structured products?**
Structured products are pre-packaged trading strategies that involve a systematic combination of a set of underlying instruments and derivatives. 
Structured products are usually created to accomplish economic goals such as providing yields, hedging tail risks, or raising financing with proper incentive alignment.
